# Submariner

## Last.fm scrobbling

Submariner includes optional Last.fm scrobbling. It uses Last.fm's desktop application authentication flow, stores the resulting session key in the macOS Keychain, sends Now Playing updates when playback starts, and scrobbles a track after it has been played for at least half its duration or four minutes, whichever comes first.

The Last.fm API requires an API key and shared secret, one per application registered at [last.fm/api/account/create](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create). Rather than building these into the app, enter your own in the Last.fm tab of Preferences; they're stored in the macOS Keychain alongside the session key.


Submariner is a Subsonic client for Mac. Originally developed by Rafaël Warnault, it was no longer maintained, and in 2012, he released it under a 3-clause BSD license.

As of 2022, I (Calvin Buckley) am fixing it up for modern macOS and Subsonic implementations. The goal is fix issues regarding compatibility, fix old bugs, add new features, modernize the application, and see what direction it should be taken in with Rafaël.

Please see the [old README](https://github.com/Read-Write/Submariner/blob/a1a10eb131eda3a073dab69423065464e9fab3ac/README.md) for past details.

## Requirements

* Submariner requires macOS 12 or newer. It works on both Intel and Apple Silicon machines.
  * The last supported version for macOS 11 is 2.4.2.
* Your Subsonic server must implement API version 1.16.1 or newer. Non-Subsonic implementations are supported, with limited OpenSubsonic extension support.

## Building

1. Clone recursively (i.e. `git clone --recursive`). Failing that, initialize submodules recursively (`git submodule update --init --recursive`). We don't use submodules at the moment, but it's a good idea to in case we do later.
2. Create `Submariner/DEVELOPMENT_TEAM.xcconfig` with contents like `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = AAAAAAAAAA`, substituting that string with your development ID. If you don't, you'll have a bad day setting up signing.
  * If you're unsure what codesigning ID to use, run `security find-identity -v -p codesigning`.
3. Use Xcode or `xcbuild` to build.

It is recommended you do `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` to avoid commiting your developer ID.
Doing so isn't fatal (it's not a secret), but it is annoying for other contributors, as Git/Xcode will want you to commit changes to your developer ID, overriding what's in the repository.

  * It requires a lot more work to work correctly with arbitrary directores together with  App Sandbox.

### Version 3.0

* macOS 12 is now the minimum version. macOS 13 or newer is recommended.
* The internal database now stores actual artist and album instead of directory IDs, alleviating many UI quirks when using Subsonic servers. (GH-73)

  * I've tried hard to make this transition as smooth as possible. Please file an issue if anything goes wrong.
  * If reloading and switching away from and back to the server doesn't help, delete recreate your server in the database.
* HTTP requests have been made more async, and shouldn't block the UI. (GH-175)
  * This comes with a major internal simplification to how requests are built, to be more idiomatic Swift.
* Adds an inspector sidebar for looking at track properties, now in default toolbar items. (GH-72)
  * This shows the selection, and the current playing track otherwise.
  * This is now the home of album art; clicking the image will show the full resolution in Quick Look.
* The tracklist now shows the length of the tracklist and count. (GH-112)
* The tracklist toolbar button will show the tracklist if you leave the cursor over the button.
* Adds an option to purge the locally downloaded/cached files. Imported files are unaffected.
* Makes the internal tracklist model index based. Duplicate tracks no longer cause UI wonkiness.

* Don't update the position slider if the window isn't visible, reducing CPU usage. (GH-171)
* Podcast episodes shouldn't duplicate when refreshing.
* Avoid downloading tracks if they're already downloaded.
* Remove some images from the app bundle to reduce application size.
* Use newer split view functionality available in modern macOS.

* Fix tracks unable to be downloaded from Subsonic servers.
* Fix a crash when trying to play an album without any tracks. (GH-166)
